Rather, these statistics reflect the systemic lack of access and opportunity for children in low-income communities.Teach For America’s (TFA) mission is to find, develop, and support a diverse network of leaders committed to expanding opportunity for children from classrooms, schools, and every sector and field that shapes the broader systems in which schools operate.

Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.As Facebook continues to expand to all corners of the world, having performant apps matters more than ever.

Our DaaS platforms support a wide range of relational database engines such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Forbes Technology Council summarizes the chief benefits listed by organizations that have successfully moved to the cloud as mainly increased efficiency, ease of access, simpler administration and management, and most importantly overall lower costs. Cloud providers who will provide the best price/performance services at scale and the highest quality of service SLAs will be better positioned to win the large-scale Enterprises and SaaS ISVs trust and adoption.Our DaaS platforms today supports predictable performance by implementing an abstraction of a resource container that guarantees a ﬁxed amount of resources (CPU, Memory, IOPS) per database. Tenants are responsible for selecting a container size suitable for their workloads, which they can manually change based on the workload demand. This static resource allocation model forces tenants to provision for peak utilization because the workload resource requirements can vary significantly within minutes to hours and it is very daunting for tenants to build complex systems to automatically resize the resource containers. This results in a poor price/performance ratio as the resource container sizes available to tenants vary by orders of magnitude both in the amount of resources as well as the monetary cost.This problem presents us with a tremendous potential to significantly differentiate Azure relational database services platform by enabling tenants to pay-per-use, disrupting the entire cloud cost economics for SaaS applications. We are a team of diverse, passionate, humble and eager engineers, data scientists, and researchers, who are driven to work together as one team to not only solve the Elastic Scaling problem for Azure DaaS, but to make a lasting contribution to the fields of Operations Research and Global Optimization.ResponsibilitiesUtilize your data instincts, predictive analysis and machine learning skills to help us predict immediate and long-term resource demand and lead us to achieve the most optimal price/performance ratio for our service.Help us detect abnormal trends in resource utilization well before it does any actual damage.Help us build the business and technical roadmap for pay-per-use strategy for Azure DaaS.Help achieve 100 % data driven decisions in design, capacity planning and management.QualificationsBasic Qualifications:4+ years of experience as data scientist3+ years’ experience programming in C# OR C++ OR Java OR PythonPreferred Qualifications:BS/MS, in machine learning, computer science, mathematics, statistics or equivalent technical or analytical fieldExperience utilizing SQL OR U-SQL OR PostgresSQLCommon ML and analysis tools (R, Python, SAS, SPSS, MatLab)Experience with deep learning, and large-scale machine learning techniquesExceptional written and verbal communication and presentation skillsAbility to meet Microsoft, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role.
