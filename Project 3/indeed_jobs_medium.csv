These are created by a talented group of designers, engineers, and product managers with whom you would work every day. And you would do it all within a forward-thinking newsroom that puts its users first and foremost.
The Data Scientist will:
analyze key questions about our products and their users;
know the questions we should be asking of our data;
implement a variety of algorithms (e.g. supervised and unsupervised machine learning, Bayesian MCMC) to support important product decisions
develop models for data collection in our products;
proactively study our data for new insights
Yes, it’s a big job! And it’s a new role for us, though you won’t be on your own in working with data at Quartz. You would be joining our analytics team, which consists of several analysts, data engineers, and a product scientist. And we have robust tracking on most of our existing products, which means you’d have rich data with which to work on day one.
To be successful in this job, you will of course need experience as a data scientist, product analyst, or something similar. And we also expect you will bring technical skills to the role: proficiency with big data cloud solutions and open source analytic tools. Experience with Python (Pandas and Scikit-Learn) is preferred, though we don’t insist on a particular language. It’s important that you can analyze and visualize data on your own.
Previous experience in media isn’t crucial, but it could definitely help. Regardless, you should have a strong interest in Quartz’s work and the many ways in which digital journalism products are different from other kinds of products. Most importantly, you should be a voice for the value of data and importance of rigorous analysis in a newsroom environment.
This job reports to the director of analytics. Candidates who can work in our New York office are strongly preferred, since our entire product team is located there, but we’ll consider applications from other locations. Please include with your application a cover letter and, if at all possible, a sample of your work in data science (github repo, a report, or other indication of what you can do).
Atlantic Media Values:
Across Atlantic Media, generally, the firm looks for two “pillar gifts” in its candidates. In all of us, these are more aspirational than actual, but they are central in our intentions.
Force of Ideas: At the center of Atlantic Media work are the ideas within our writing. We believe that ideas – to the good and not – have consequence. Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual honesty, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, giving voice, argument, and flight to the latter.
Spirit of Generosity: Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks a spirit of generosity – a natural disposition in each colleague toward service and selfless conduct. Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth – critical on the merits but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.

About Tumblr

Tumblr launched in 2007 with the belief that people need for a place to say what they want, be who they want, and connect over what they love. Now, 10 years and hundreds of millions of blogs later, we continue to build out Tumblr as a platform for free expression, individuality, and human connection.

From art to music to dank memes to social justice, we’re proud to serve all the subcultures that call Tumblr home, and even more proud of the impact they’ve had the world. No matter what department you work with here, you’ll be working to give our users a voice, and to make that voice heard far and wide.

Our commitment to diversity

Tumblr is a platform for diverse communities to express diverse points of view, and we’re committed to hiring a workforce that reflects that. We know that teams who bring a variety of backgrounds and perspectives into their work build better products—and that better products mean, in turn, a better experience for all of the communities we serve.

organize the overwhelming amount of data they deal with
analyze it for patterns and predictions
deliver these insights in a readily accessible, freely explorable way
and do it again, repeatedly and reliably, as more data comes in the door

The data science team at Custora can be found hard at work at each step above. Our projects range from the development and refinement of statistical models, to the design and implementation of scalable back-end infrastructure that powers our analyses, to collaboration with other teams at Custora to make sure customers get the most out of our analyses.

We place particular emphasis on providing a robust system of statistical insights. Our goal is not to deliver a single paper or presentation’s worth of material, but to give our customers a powerful analytical toolbox. We can help them use it, but we also want them to be able to take it and run with it, exploring their data on their own and finding uses for our models that we hadn’t even thought of.

On top of that, we have an expanding customer base and a growing interest in developing analyses and statistical modeling pipelines that extend beyond e-commerce. With more customers, richer data sets, and new domains of exploration, we’ll face bigger and bigger challenges, but we think we’re up for it, and we are looking for people who want to join us for the ride.

Specifically, we are looking for:
A solid foundation in statistics, either demonstrated through academic study or work experience.
Experience with at least two programming languages and one general-purpose statistical package or programming library. The data science team mainly uses R, Scala, and Ruby, but that’s not set in stone, and we value the ability to learn new libraries and ecosystems.
Friendly and ready to work with others, both technical and non-technical. We don’t work in isolation and regularly interact with each other and members of other teams.
At least some familiarity with: Unix-like operating systems, SQL databases, and web application programming. Strong experience in any is a plus.
Other pluses: experience with distributed-computing ecosystems like Spark; experience with Amazon Web Services; experience teaching statistics or programming

What it’s like to work here:
On Monday we eat and meet as a team to chat projects and progress.
We’re 45 genuinely nice people. We work together and experiment with how to do things. It’s an amazing environment to both explore your professional interests and shape your career trajectory.
We move quickly. You build something and the next day it comes to life. You see and feel an immediate impact with the collective efforts of the team.

From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new learning algorithms, Research Scientists work on challenges in machine perception, data mining, machine learning, and natural language understanding. As a Google Research Scientist, you will continue to be an active contributor to the wider research community by collaborating with academic researchers and by publishing papers.


Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.


The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems. We have resources and access to projects impossible to find elsewhere. Our broad and fundamental research goals allow us to collaborate closely with and–contribute uniquely to–many different product teams across the company.

The quality of the algorithms we develop must be highly defensible and transparent to those who use the data for trading. We apply various quantitative methods for data cleaning and price generation, and build the tools needed to validate and monitor online quality. Backtesting is a key part of our algorithm development.
Some of the biggest technical challenges we face are those of scale; we must produce pricing in real time, while taking in millions of data points per minute. We achieve low latency and high throughput via distributed computing that scales horizontally.
As a Data Scientist you will help lead our research efforts as well as develop production-quality systems to further expand our product. You will work closely with our highly-quantitative product side to design the models for these systems.

Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.
As Facebook continues to expand to all corners of the world, having performant apps matters more than ever.

This position will directly engage with the CTO for the Facebook app and have the opportunity to directly shape our investments and roadmap for the next 3 years. Some key challenges we’re looking to solve in the next year include: How often do users have a “bad experience” while using the apps? How can we quantify this and how does it affect engagement? What sectors of the population are the most sensitive to performance regressions and how should we adapt our strategy as a result? How should we prioritize our efforts across different users and performance metrics to deliver the best possible performing app?
